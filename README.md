 This project is an ASP.NET Core MVC application that follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and uses Entity Framework for data persistence.
 The data is stored in a Microsoft SQL Server database, which ensures data consistency and reliability. 
 The application has two user roles, "administrator" and "alperen", and users can log in with their respective accounts.
 Upon logging in, users are presented with several controllers, including Author, Book, BookType, and Home.
 Through these controllers, users can add, edit, and delete information about authors and book types.
 Users can also add and edit information about books, including their titles, authors, and types.
 Users can "log out" of their accounts when they're done.

 
 I hope you find this project as interesting and useful as I do, and I welcome any feedback or questions you might have.

("ASP .NET Core MVC is a web application for saving and managing book types, author names and book information in my project, which I developed in accordance with the Entity Framework and OOP rules
.-The Book Type Controller included in the project allows users to add, edit and delete book types, while the Author Controller is designed for adding, editing and deleting the names of authors.
Changes made by users during all these operations are stored in the MSSQL database.)
